\section{Memory management}

\subsection{Page table structure}

The page table is a lazy, two level page table.  

\begin{verbatim}
#define PAGEWORDS (PAGESIZE / sizeof(L4_Word_t))

typedef struct  {
	L4_Word_t pages[PAGEWORDS];
} Pagetable2;

typedef struct {
	Pagetable2 *pages2[PAGEWORDS];
} Pagetable1;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Address location}

To locate the 32 bit virtual address \texttt{v}, the highest 12 bits are used to index in to the first level of the table (\texttt{Pagetable1}) in order to find the corresponding second level struct.  If this is \texttt{NULL}, this second level is dynamically created.  The middle 12 bits of \texttt{v} are then used to index in to this second level, locating the relevant entry \texttt{e}.  Note that the lowest 12 bits of \texttt{v} are not needed for page table addressing.

The high 24 bits of \texttt{e} give the \emph{page aligned} physical address\footnote{In fact, ppage} of what \texttt{v} is mapped to.  The lower 12 bits are then used to maintain status bits, for example the reference bit and swapped status.

\subsection{Region management}

Regions are managed with a linked list of \texttt{Region} structs.

\begin{verbatim}
struct Region_t {
	region_type type;
	uintptr_t base;
	unsigned int size;
	unsigned int filesize;
	int rights;
	int mapDirectly;
	Swapfile *elffile;
};
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{type} is used to differentiate between the stack, heap, and other regions.  It is important to know which region is the heap in order for the \texttt{moremem} system call to function, see Section \ref{sub:moremem}.
\item \texttt{base}, \texttt{size}, and \texttt{rights} are the self explanitory.
\item \texttt{filesize} is the size of the region as it appears on file, important for ELF loading.
\item \texttt{mapDirectly} is solely important for programs loaded from bootinfo, which require their text and data sections to be 1:1 mapped to physical memory.
\item \texttt{elffile} is the ELF file the region is located on, represented as a swap file (see Section \ref{sub:demandpaging}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Page fault mechanism}

The page fault mechanism is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The faulting region is located.  If no region is found, or if the type of access which causes the fault (read/write/exec) is illegal, the faulting process is killed (see Section \ref{sub:process_delete}).
\item If the faulting address is on disk, the page fault is added to the ``blocking'' queue to be dealt with asynchronously.\item If the faulting address needs to be 1:1 mapped, the mapping is immediately made.
\item Otherwise, a frame attempts to be allocated for the fault.  If there are no free frames, the fault is again delayed for later.
\item Assuming nothing is delayed, the reference bit is set (for the second chance algorithm, Section \ref{sub:secondchange}) and the mapping made.
\end{enumerate}

Specific discussion of the asynchronous paging mechanism, see Section \ref{sub:demandpaging}.

\subsection{Kernel memory}

The kernel is designed in such a way that it assumes it can always allocate frames for itself, a problem when userspace programs are allocated frames from the same pool.  To solve this, the number of userspace frames are artificially limited to a constant amount (\texttt{FRAME\_ALLOC\_LIMIT}), chosen conservatively enough to ensure the kernel will never run out of memory, but generous enough for the limit to only be observable when memory is deliberately thrashed.

This policy has several advantages.  The kernel can run out of physical memory, not virtual, and it requires no complicated IO in order to safely do so.  The kernel can easily allocate temporary frames, useful when creating processes and for ``pinning'' frames to ensure fairness when swapping out.  This also makes testing the memory management easy, by setting the alloc limit very low.
