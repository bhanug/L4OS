/* List of TODO which aren't of high importance or nessecary */

- Move more things to the generic linked list implementation.
	- Process management (with threads)
	- irq
	- Bootinfo

- Move process deleting back to process.c (from pager.c) if possible.  Still
want to minimise the interface to the pager though.

- Don't ever close the default swapfile, and only ever open it

- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.
