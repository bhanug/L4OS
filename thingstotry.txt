- allocate pids in a round robin, i.e. don't reuse the most recent pid.
The forkbombs might be dying due to some kind of contention here.

- Check all uses of char* (should use char blah[MAX_FILE_NAME]) and also, that
the null terminating byte is always present.  So maybe blah[MFN + 1]?
Certainly, it would seem that each time it must be manually NULL terminated.

- Is the pager interfering anywhere with the main thread, apart from
pager_buffer?  Anywhere?  All the other functions in pager.h have no
sideeffects, so either pager_buffer is broken (very unlikely)

- Ok wait, I think that copyInOutData is broken.
	copyInOutData = (L4_Word_t*) allocFrames(sizeof(L4_Word_t));
Actually, it's not broken, just a silly formula.  Should change this to include
PAGESIZE and MAX_THREADS in some way.

- Reduce MAX_THREADS, increase MAX_IO_BUF?
