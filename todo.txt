- Very frequently SOS hangs on bootup on "waiting for PHY to become ready", with
*** sos_pager_handler: addr=0x0000000c ip=0x001488e4 sender=0
This might be our problem, not sure.  Not the same as the other unhandled page
fault that often happens (on a high address) which everybody gets and certainly
isn't our fault.

- Update crt (whatever that is) to kill a process when it finishes.  At the
moment it just pagefaults like crazy.  Apparently this is a mystery funtion
somewhere, possibly written in assembler (?), or alternatively _Exit or _Abort
should get called too.

- Free L4's resources when deleting process.

- ELF loading.  Note that we should aim to load everything by setting the
relevant memory sections of whichever process as being on disk, and then having
a (potentially) different swap file for each one.  This will require (at least):
   - A swapfile struct for every region (just every process isn't enough).  This
   now exists but all through the code it is assumed to be the default one.
   - That we figure out how to create ELF files that are formatted in nice ways
   (page aligned to something would be ideal).  Either that or the pager/regions
   need to be changed to support non-pagealigned addresses where necessary.
   - That the swapfiles are checked for access permissions.  Obviously we
   shouldn't be able to write back to the ELF files or we'll destroy them, and
   it's easy enough to open these as read only, but the pager code should
   account for this.  A function in VFS to quickly get permissions?  Or a hack
   to only write to the default swapfile?

- Check memory leaks in pager

- More test cases for the linked list.  Needs to be absolutely rock solid.

- Move more things to the generic linked list implementation.
	- Timer driver
	- Process management (with threads)
	- irq
	- Bootinfo
	- ...
	- Filesystem stuff?

- This has been around for ages, but there is a security bug in copyin/out
where the user can violate read/write access permissions.  Need to write a
program to show this but won't be too hard.  Also won't be a hard fix.

- Clean up copyin/out as well, there is a lot of repetition across the two
functions and they aren't so nice anyway.

- A more intelligent way of giving tids - not using the caps.  Force all system
calls to include the calling thread as the somethingth argument in the message.
Perhaps, the 31st (something like that).  This info is kept in the user defined
TCR.  For security (not letting a process spoof another one) check this tid
against the sender space when it arrives.
Note that this is just a nice thing to do, it's not a problem as such.

- The count for size-of-processes isn't being set properly.  Need to fix.

- investigate moving the kernel heap size setting to constants.h

- have the init_thread finish instead of just constantly sleeping.
- And use frame_alloc as a stack for its stack rather than a static array.

- Improve syscall interface. Have a generic IPC library which provides our var arg
handle functions and use that for making system calls on both the user space side
and kernel side rather then duplicating code on both side like currently. Also
use jump table/function pointer array handling on receive side instead of giant
switch.
- (Comment) I agree, the libsos stuff would be nicer with varargs.  However the
switch is compiled as a jump table already so that's not really an issue.

- There are comments in the code about not blocking SOS for too long on (what I
assume is) console writing.  It's pretty negligible but yeah I can see that the
problem does exist.  It's buffered now, so what we "need" (if we were to do it)
is a thread to do the flushing.

- There is a comment you made in the commit log ("Improve performance of console
fs, sends more then one char at a time now") but I did this myself in the master
branch a while ago.  They seem to have merged but it's worth looking to see if
we can get rid of one.  Probably mine, since it's a buffer-hack to network_puts
(aka network_sendstring_char).

- Move process deleting back to process.c (from pager.c) if possible.  Still
want to minimise the interface to the pager though.

- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.
