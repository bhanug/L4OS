- Physical frames are being gradually consumed whenever processes are run.  Very
odd.  Need to fix this, since it means eventually we will run out of memory...

- roottask read pagefault at 00000004, ip=001453e4 - deny
Happenning after a SOS copyin.  This need to be fixed, happening on ps.  Oh and
also a bunch of other stuff involving NFS now apparently.  I'm pretty confident
this is a problem in NFS not with the linked list code.

- The "DONT PANIC" assertion is getting fired.  I'm to to rewrite some of the
ELF/swapping stuff anyway (to use mmap) so not worth fixing this yet.  Pretty
rare anyway.

- Move back to a single-threaded model, just make the syscall_reply a callback
rather than syscall_reply.  That way a function in the pager can be called.
I think this is nicer than the various hacks we have around the place to make
the pager thing actually work.

- Get rid of FRAME_ALLOC_LIMIT before handing in.
