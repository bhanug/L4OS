- Use a smarter way of limiting frames.  Namely, when they "start running out"
begin to swap out user frames.  If a kernel frame alloc ever fails, then kill
the process using the most frames and try again.

- Replace assertions with killing/deleting the offending process.  Since, the
failed assertions will probably be due to the process doing something stupid.

- Check closing and opening of files at process startup and shutdown is safe.
