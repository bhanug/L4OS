- The "DONT PANIC" assertion is getting fired.

- Use a smarter way of limiting frames.  Namely, when they "start running out"
begin to swap out user frames.  If a kernel frame alloc ever fails, then kill
the process using the most frames and try again.

- Documentation.

- Check there are no side effects in assertions (so that we can disable them
easily when we hand in).

- Replace assertions with killing/deleting the offending process.  Since, the
failed assertions will probably be due to the process doing something stupid.

- Forkbomb runs fine when just creating 1 process but forking out 2 each run causes a
segmentation fork after a little while (around 30 processes).

- There is still a small memory leak somewhere.
