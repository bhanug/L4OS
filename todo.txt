- Milestone 6 - also, think ahead with ELF loading and as such, a generalised
swap file (rather than assumings it's always .swap or whatever).  

- Testing.  Jesus we need to do more testing.

- Investigate moving the sync request code into the vfs layer rather than fs.

- Move MaxReader, MaxWriter and the reader, writer counters out of consolefs
into the vfs and then handle opening already open vnodes in the vfs layer
instead of having each fs handle it

- Put extra data in the page table struct - we always have the lower 12 bits
free, can use this as a permissions bitmask and for demand paging status bits,
etc.  *** NOTE *** that when this happens, various functions that use the
findPageTableWord function will break.  Will need to fix them!

- Put /all/ process/thread specific stuff in to the PCB (Process struct, in
process.[ch]).  I'm looking at the file tables right now.

- There is a bug in uptime somewhere... perhaps with sosh actually.  But it's
getting negative.

- Need to pin pages when preparing the callback to read them in over NFS.

- Get rid of rval as an argument to every single fs-related function, and fix
the hack that is the global rval value in syscall.

- Check that copyin/out calls don't override the size of the buffer.

- stat is broken due to either a miscalculation of the offset when doing the
syscall (on either side) OR copyout (and probably in as well) is broken when
it comes to appending data rather than simply writing over.
