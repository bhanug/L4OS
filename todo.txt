- Physical frames are being gradually consumed whenever processes are run.  Very
odd.  Need to fix this, since it means eventually we will run out of memory...
Just to do with new processes, (e.g internal sosh commands, even things such as
cat'ing large files are fine). Always two frames it appears. Must be some resource
not being freed properly.

- The "DONT PANIC" assertion is getting fired.  I'm to to rewrite some of the
ELF/swapping stuff anyway (to use mmap) so not worth fixing this yet.  Pretty
rare anyway.

- Get rid of FRAME_ALLOC_LIMIT before handing in.
 --> This isn't at all possible.  We can at least make it quite large though.
 --> (david) What is wrong with how I have changed the pager to set the allocLimit
 to the available frames determined when the frame table starts up?

- Finish mmap.  (wishlist: make it work for writing too, since then we really
would have mmap and it would be awesome).

- Documentation.

- Check for rights in copyin/out, pagefaults

- Set MAX_THEADS to 256.  Perhaps arrange so that 4 address spaces aren't being
wasted on the network/init/pager threads.
 --> (david) Yeah sure, I kind of like having them stored in the process struct but they
 do artificially use up process slots. Maybe we can have a different process list
 for kernel threads (except for sos which stays where it is).
 --> (david) Why change max threads to 256? I just changed the PID allocator
 to use MAX_ADDRESSES instead of threads and have tested allocating up to the max
 processes quite extensively.

- Look at putting all the statically allocate data structures (currently
created with frame_alloc) as actual static data structures.
 --> Why? we moved away from this before?

- Check there are no side effects in assertions (so that we can disable them
easily when we hand in).

- Replace assertions with killing/deleting the offending process.  Since, the
failed assertions will probably be due to the process doing something stupid.

- Page fault should invalidate cache?  But the cache is turned off...

- Get rid of callbacks altogether in the structs?  Just use stack?

- Forkbomb runs fine when just creating 1 process but forking out 2 each run causes a
segmentation fork after a little while (around 30 processes).
