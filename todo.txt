- Physical frames are being gradually consumed whenever processes are run.  Very
odd.  Need to fix this, since it means eventually we will run out of memory...
Just to do with new processes, (e.g internal sosh commands, even things such as
cat'ing large files are fine). Always two frames it appears. Must be some resource
not being freed properly.

- The "DONT PANIC" assertion is getting fired.  I'm to to rewrite some of the
ELF/swapping stuff anyway (to use mmap) so not worth fixing this yet.  Pretty
rare anyway.

- Get rid of FRAME_ALLOC_LIMIT before handing in.
 --> This isn't at all possible.  We can at least make it quite large though.

- Finish mmap.  (wishlist: make it work for writing too, since then we really
would have mmap and it would be awesome).

- Documentation.

- Check for rights in copyin/out, pagefaults
