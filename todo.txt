- Physical frames are being gradually consumed whenever processes are run.  Very
odd.  Need to fix this, since it means eventually we will run out of memory...

- The "DONT PANIC" assertion is getting fired.  I'm to to rewrite some of the
ELF/swapping stuff anyway (to use mmap) so not worth fixing this yet.  Pretty
rare anyway.

- Move back to a single-threaded model, just make the syscall_reply a callback
rather than syscall_reply.  That way a function in the pager can be called.
I think this is nicer than the various hacks we have around the place to make
the pager thing actually work.

- Add process type

- Get rid of FRAME_ALLOC_LIMIT before handing in.
 --> This isn't at all possible.  We can at least make it quite large though.

- Finish mmap.  (wishlist: make it work for writing too, since then we really
would have mmap and it would be awesome).

- Documentation.
