- Free L4's resources when deleting process.

- ELF loading.  Note that we should aim to load everything by setting the
relevant memory sections of whichever process as being on disk, and then having
a (potentially) different swap file for each one.  This will require (at least):
   - A swapfile struct for every region (just every process isn't enough).  This
   now exists but all through the code it is assumed to be the default one.
   - That we figure out how to create ELF files that are formatted in nice ways
   (page aligned to something would be ideal).  Either that or the pager/regions
   need to be changed to support non-pagealigned addresses where necessary.
   - That the swapfiles are checked for access permissions.  Obviously we
   shouldn't be able to write back to the ELF files or we'll destroy them, and
   it's easy enough to open these as read only, but the pager code should
   account for this.  A function in VFS to quickly get permissions?  Or a hack
   to only write to the default swapfile?

- Check memory leaks in pager

- More test cases for the linked list.  Needs to be absolutely rock solid.

- This has been around for ages, but there is a security bug in copyin/out
where the user can violate read/write access permissions.  Need to write a
program to show this but won't be too hard.  Also won't be a hard fix.

- Clean up copyin/out as well, there is a lot of repetition across the two
functions and they aren't so nice anyway.

- Move process deleting back to process.c (from pager.c) if possible.  Still
want to minimise the interface to the pager though.

- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.

- Change the callback sequencer to use enums rather than magic state.  Then...

- Check exec permissions when trying to run an ELF file.

- Max clists is 16, so despite having max addrspaces as 256 it will crash
after creating something like 16 processes.  So, need to increase the #define
(pistachio/src/caps.cc) and also free the clists and all that stuff (as per
the todo above).

- Scrap the ELF file is a swap file thing (goddamn it) and just load them
as a separate process.  And remember to zero the whole thing first, and only
copy up to filesiz (but region goes up to memsiz).
