- Free L4's resources when deleting process.  This involves (as mentioned in
process.c), freeing the capabilties (to rootserver and pager), freeing the
address space, and then freeing the capability list.  Should probably check
that the whole address space for that process is being unmapped too.

- This has been around for ages, but there is a security bug in copyin/out
where the user can violate read/write access permissions.  Need to write a
program to show this but won't be too hard.  Also won't be a hard fix.

- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.

- Don't ever close the default swapfile, and only ever open it

- Move all the console functions from sosh in to the ELF file.  In fact, get
rid of the sosh directly and just put it in the bin directory, then make the
only program that runs from bootinfo is one that continually executes sosh.
And waits for it to finish.

- Stress test with multiple processes.

- Test accessing regions without permissions, and also kill proceses when
they throw exceptions.  Not very hard.
