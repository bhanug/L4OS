- Free L4's resources when deleting process.  This involves (as mentioned in
process.c), freeing the capabilties (to rootserver and pager), freeing the
address space, and then freeing the capability list.  Should probably check
that the whole address space for that process is being unmapped too.

- This has been around for ages, but there is a security bug in copyin/out
where the user can violate read/write access permissions.  Need to write a
program to show this but won't be too hard.  Also won't be a hard fix.

- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.

- Stress test with multiple processes.  Okay, so there is a problem somewhere
causing this to not work.  Not sure where, could be the pager, could be VFS
(although I'd say most likely the pager, I've never tested it so heavily, but
who knows).

- The first process that starts from sosh segfaults, the rest are ok.

- Kill (delete) proceses when they throw exceptions.
