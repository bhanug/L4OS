- More testing of killing processes at awkward times, for example in the middle
of swapping in or swapping out.

- Stress test with multiple processes.  Okay, so there is a problem somewhere
causing this to not work.  Not sure where, could be the pager, could be VFS
(although I'd say most likely the pager, I've never tested it so heavily, but
who knows).

- Physical frames are being gradually consumed whenever processes are run.  Very
odd.  Need to fix this, since it means eventually we will run out of memory...

- roottask read pagefault at 00000004, ip=001453e4 - deny
Happenning after a SOS copyin.  This need to be fixed, happening on ps.

- I've also seen a process give an exception on a high (0xe9???) address and
thereby crash.  Well, there is a TODO to fix this but really the exception
shouldn't be happenning in the first place.
