- Clean, stable, robust, and completed SOS.

- User network library.  Handled through VFS?  Internally use TCP-over-UDP?

- USB stack/driver/library.

- Pipes.

- Editor (user program, nothing to do with SOS unless it involves writing a few
more system calls).  Like red.

- Thread management.

- Shared memory.

- Kernel VM 

- Port a unix tool to our OS to prove its robustness. (e.g grep or something
similar which should be complicated in function but not use to many system
calls since we are not POSIX compliant).

- Support multiple consoles.

- Support directories.

- Move most of sosh's built in commands to sepperate programs and allow them
to be killed with CTRL-C.

- Have a hard code stable program which runs and is responsible for spawning sosh.
If sosh crashes, it starts it up again...
